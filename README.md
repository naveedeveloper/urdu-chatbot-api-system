# Urdu Chatbot API System
- The primary objective of the "Urdu Chatbot API System" is to provide an intelligent and interactive conversational interface for Urdu-speaking users.
- The project employs LSTM, a deep learning model, to enable the chatbot to understand and generate responses in the Urdu language accurately.
- LSTM is particularly suitable for modeling sequential data, making it an ideal choice for natural language processing tasks.
- The Flask framework is utilized to create a RESTful API that exposes endpoints for interacting with the chatbot system.
- The API endpoints accept user queries in the form of text input and return the generated responses from the LSTM model.

## Training Phase
- The training phase involves collecting a large dataset of Urdu conversations, preprocessing the data, and training the LSTM model using the processed data.
- The LSTM model learns the patterns and structures of the Urdu language, enabling it to generate meaningful and contextually relevant responses.

## Applications
- The "Urdu Chatbot API System" can be utilized in a wide range of applications, including customer support services, language learning platforms, and virtual assistant applications.
- Its ability to comprehend and respond accurately in the Urdu language fills a crucial gap in the availability of conversational AI systems for Urdu-speaking users.
